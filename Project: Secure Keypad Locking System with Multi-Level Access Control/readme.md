This project involved designing and implementing a digital locking system using a servo motor, 4x3 keypad, LEDs, and a buzzer on the BASYS 3 FPGA board. The system features passcode-based access control, an admin override for failed attempts, and a reset function, all controlled via VHDL. I designed PWM signals for precise servo control, implemented debouncing techniques to ensure accurate keypad inputs, and carefully managed state transitions to create a robust and secure access system. This project required extensive debugging, hardware-software integration, and problem-solving, deepening my understanding of digital design, FPGA programming, and embedded system implementation.
