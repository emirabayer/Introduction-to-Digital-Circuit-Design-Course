## Personal Course Project - Secure Keypad Locking System with Multi-Level Access Control
This project involved designing and implementing a digital locking system using a servo motor, 4x3 keypad, LEDs, and a buzzer on the BASYS 3 FPGA board. The system features passcode-based access control, an admin override for failed attempts, and a reset function, all controlled via VHDL. I designed PWM signals for precise servo control, implemented debouncing techniques to ensure accurate keypad inputs, and carefully managed state transitions to create a robust and secure access system. This project required extensive debugging, hardware-software integration, and problem-solving, deepening my understanding of digital design, FPGA programming, and embedded system implementation.

## Lab 1 - Debugging and Testing Combinational Circuits in VHDL
This lab focused on identifying and correcting errors in a given VHDL design, simulating its behavior using a testbench, and implementing it on the BASYS3 FPGA. The process involved waveform analysis, RTL inspection, and verifying the circuit's functionality through hardware testing.

## Lab 2: - Implementing Combinational Logic on a Breadboard
This lab focused on building a combinational logic circuit using logic gates and a 74HC163 counter on a breadboard. The circuit was tested using an oscilloscope and LEDs to verify correct truth table implementation, ensuring proper signal propagation and debugging as needed.

## Lab 3: - Designing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in VHDL
This lab involved designing and implementing an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with eight operations, including arithmetic, bitwise, and shift functions. The ALU was built modularly in VHDL, simulated for verification, and deployed on an FPGA with outputs displayed through LEDs.

## Lab 4: - Seven-Segment Display Multiplexing in VHDL
This lab focused on controlling multiple seven-segment displays on the Basys 3 FPGA using multiplexing and the persistence of vision effect. A clock divider, counter, decoder, and multiplexer were implemented in VHDL, simulated for verification, and tested on hardware to display multiple digits simultaneously.

## Lab 5: - Arbitrary Waveform Generator in VHDL
This lab involved designing a digital waveform generator in VHDL using the Clocking Wizard IP to produce precise timing signals. A testbench was created to verify waveform accuracy through simulation, and the output was measured on an oscilloscope to ensure correct frequency and timing behavior.

## Lab 6: - Finite State Machine (FSM) on a Breadboard
This lab focused on designing and implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) using logic gates on a breadboard. The state transition diagram, tables, and logic expressions were derived, and the circuit was built using buttons for inputs and LEDs/oscilloscope for output verification.
